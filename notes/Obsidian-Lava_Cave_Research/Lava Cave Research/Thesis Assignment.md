Investigate Lunar pits and look for potential underground cavities. Also classify pits into Lava Tube cave, crater Lava Cave and depression with no underground space

Create a tool for it, which is itself a part of the assignment
Create dataset processor to gather better resolution data for the suspected objects

Papers:
 - This paper is about temperature anomalies of possible lunar pits, uses Diviner data to look for anomalies, will probably by one of the core metrics
