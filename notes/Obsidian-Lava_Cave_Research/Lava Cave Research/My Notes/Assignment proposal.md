#### **Diploma Thesis:**
The thesis will investigate potential indicators of subsurface cavities or anomalies in lunar pits using thermal, gravitational, and radar datasets collected by lunar orbiters.

In the first stage, the student will study past lunar orbital missions and datasets focusing on temperature variations, gravitational anomalies, and radar reflectivity. The student will also familiarize themselves with the processes involved in the formation of lunar pits and reference the Lunar Pits Atlas.

The student will design a modular, distributed system using a master-slave architecture to download, filter, and process datasets. The system will filter data by temporal and spatial relevance, align observations using SPICE kernels, and process historical data to identify regions of interest around lunar pits. Signal processing will focus on detecting temperature and time-series anomalies using practical and efficient methods suited to the data.

The thesis aims to explore the feasibility of identifying subsurface cavities in lunar pits, which could serve as natural shelters for future missions by providing radiation shielding and milder temperature conditions.
